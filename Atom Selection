EXAMPLE

                                     # including all atoms named 
                                     # "C","O","N", or "CA";
   PyMOL> color red, bb              # color the selection red,
   PyMOL> hide lines, bb             # hide the line representation,
   PyMOL> show sticks, bb            # show it using the stick representation
   
   select bb, (name P+C5')
