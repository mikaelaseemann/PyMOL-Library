#0	stick from backbone atom to N1 of purines and N3 of pyrimidines
#1	simple plane for ribose and base rings covering area between ring bonds
#2	simple plane for ribose and base rings covering area inside sticks (slightly smaller than mode 1)
#3	plane bounded by sticks for ribose and base rings
#4	large sphere of ring diameter at centre of ribose and each base ring
#5	small sphere of 1/10 diameter at centre of ribose and each base ring
#6+	appears to default to ring mode 2
select backbone #change to cartoon style after NA in stick mode
